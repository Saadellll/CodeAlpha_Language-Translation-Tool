# Language Translation Tool

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for building a language translation tool using Python. The tool utilizes the transformers library from Hugging Face and other necessary packages to perform translations between different languages.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, you need to install the following packages:

- `transformers`
- `sentencepiece`
- `langid`

These can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install transformers
pip install sentencepiece
pip install langid
```

## Usage

To use the language translation tool, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-translation-tool.git
```

### Install the Necessary Packages

Ensure that you have all the required packages installed. You can run the cells in the notebook that contain the `pip install` commands, or manually install them as shown above.

### Run the Notebook

Open the `Language_Translation_Tool.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment and execute the cells sequentially.

### Input and Translation

Follow the instructions in the notebook to input text and translate it into the desired language. The notebook contains code cells that guide you through the translation process.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook contains the following sections:

- **Installation:** Commands to install the required packages.
- **Code:** The main code for language translation using Hugging Face's transformers.

## Example Usage

Here is an example of how you can use the language translation tool:

### Load the Translation Model

```python
from transformers import MarianMTModel, MarianTokenizer

model_name = 'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr'
model = MarianMTModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = MarianTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

### Translate Text

```python
def translate(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True)
    translated_tokens = model.generate(**inputs)
    translated_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(translated_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)
    return translated_text

text = "Hello, how are you?"
translated_text = translate(text)
print(translated_text)  # Output: "Bonjour, comment Ã§a va ?"
```
